# FTIndustries BMI160 IMU breakout
![preview](https://github.com/FTIndustries/BMI160-Breakout/blob/main/3dpreview.png?raw=true)\
Sensor breakout using Bosch Sensortec's BMI160 6DoF IMU, supporting Adafruit STEMMA QT / Sparkfun Qwiic system. It uses the same form factor as well-known unbranded boards and it is pin-to-pin compatible. but unlike them, it does not feature SPI interface and 3.3V LDO due to lack of PCB space. You should power this board 3.3V, not 5V. Higher voltages will damage the board.
